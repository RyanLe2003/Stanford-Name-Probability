# Stanford Name Probability

Imagine being in a class where not only one, but possibly two students share your name. How likely is it for such a coincidence to occur?

By considering various factors such as name uniqueness, gender distribution, class size, and availability across different class years, we can gain insights into the likelihood of this intriguing occurrence.
